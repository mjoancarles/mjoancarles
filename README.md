### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Science and Analytics student from Barcelona, deeply passionate about leveraging machine learning to solve real-world problems and contributing positively to our society.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently finishing my data science degree at Universitat AutÃ²noma de Barcelona, where I've honed my Python skills, explored the depths of artificial intelligence, and delved into big data analysis.
- ðŸ”­ At Merck KGaA, I've applied my academic insights to craft real-world AI solutions, with a focus on machine learning and generative AI. My work encompasses the enhancement of image captioning via BLIP models, the integration of NLP APIs for advanced language understanding, and the strategic application of classical algorithms. Additionally, I've employed AWS for various purposes, including the creation and distribution of usage reports for our applications. This, alongside the development of personalized pharmaceutical marketing strategies through recommendation systems and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), showcases the breadth of my contributions.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m eager to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of machine learning and data science.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about my projects on image captioning and similarity, [Skin Cancer Classification](https://github.com/mjoancarles/Skin-Cancer-Classification) with a TensorFlow CNN, or any other data science endeavors.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: joan.carles.montero@gmail.com. You can also connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joan-carles-montero-jimenez/).
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: Besides data science, I deeply enjoy playing video games, meeting new people, and exploring the underwater world through scuba diving. Feel free to join me in any adventure, above or below the sea!
